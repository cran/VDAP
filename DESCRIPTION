Description: Analyze Peptide Array Data and characterize peptide
    sequence space. Allows for high level visualization of global signal, Quality control based
    on replicate correlation and/or relative Kd, calculation of peptide Length/Charge/Kd parameters,
    Hits selection based on RFU Signal, and amino acid composition/basic motif recognition with RFU
    signal weighting. Basic signal trends can be used to generate peptides that follow the observed
    compositional trends.
